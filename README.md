# simple_ciphers

Includes simple ciphers for enciphering and deciphering text documents.
For now, this includes a Caesar cipher and a Mono-alphabetic Substitution cipher.

An example text file is provided, but you may change the contents if you wish.


CAESAR CIPHER:
Press '1' to activate.
Input the number you wish to shift by.


MONO-ALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION CIPHER:
Press '2' to activate.
You will be prompted to input a letter to replace each letter in the alphabet.
There cannot be repeats, so if you accidentally input the same letter twice, you can try again.
This will create an alphabet-length key which will be used to encipher/decipher the given text.
